- Authority (or the sense of it)       
- Lack of familiarity / knowledge 
- Trust

Let's dive deeper into a few examples on how they use these: 

Example 1: Scammers may try to scare you by threatening harm on you or your loved ones unless you comply with their demands.

How do they accomplish this?

- They may have obtained your information such as address and your family members information from public record, and taken screenshots of the outside of your house using Google Earth (a free public satellite imagery software) this can make their victims think they can actually follow through with these threats.

When you are scared you are more likely to comply. Later on we will go over the best ways to avoid scams and what to do if you think you've been targeted.

Example 2: Scammers often try to pose as authorities such as the IRS, Police / FBI, Lawyers, etc.

How do they accomplish this?

- They usually threaten huge fines and / or imprisonment in the hopes that they can scare you into paying them a smaller, yet still huge amount of money for them to make it go away.
-----------------------------------------------------

Example 3: Scammers often pose as tech support workers of reputable companies that you already trust in order to extort money for unnecessary services.

How do they accomplish this?

- This usually occurs when you are browsing the internet either on your phone, tablet, or computer, and a message pops up telling you that a virus has been detected on your system and to call a certain number to get it removed.
