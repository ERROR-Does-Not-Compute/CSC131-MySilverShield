How can you protect yourself from a telephone scam?

- Dont have the number in your contacts or you do not recognize the number? Don't pick it up! If it is important, they'll leave you a voicemail. (Even if they leave a voicemail be very speculative about it.)

- If you do pick up the phone, recognize the most commong phone scams.
	- The IRS will NOT call you EVER.
	- NEVER send money over the phone.
	- If they ask you to go to a retail store and buy a gift card, iTunes card, Steam card, etc. IT IS 100% A SCAM!

If you do get a call that is suspected spam, just block their number, contact the authorities, hang up and call a family member and try to explain the situation.

It is important to remember that the goal of most scammers is to use social engineering to try and scare you into immediate action and isolate you into immediate action and isolate you / keep you from talking to anyone else.

Do not be afraid to ask other people, friends, and family members if they think it is a scam.

The best way to protect yourself is to assume every call or email you don't recognize the sender and every message that pops up on your screen or freezes your computer is a scam.
