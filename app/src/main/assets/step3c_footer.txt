It is important to remember that the goal of most scammers is to use social engineering to try and scare you into immediate action and isolate you into immediate action and isolate you / keep you from talking to anyone else.

Do not be afraid to ask other people, friends, and family members if they think it is a scam.

The best way to protect yourself is to assume every call or email you don't recognize the sender and every message that pops up on your screen or freezes your computer is a scam.
